## Project Description:

Ho'ohui is an augmented reality experiment done for a Haptic Interface class at CU Boulder.

Today, mixed reality is an emerging technology and is expected to have high demands in various applications. Therefore, we wanted to give the example on how others can experiment with this technology, in our case with augmented reality to build this open sourced project. Augmented reality tehcnologies right now are expensive and with this type of project it can become more accessible to anyone.

Moreover, most applications in augmented reality do not offer enough kinesthetic communication or the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. Therefore, in our use case scenario we implement haptics to our example of using augmented reality to visualize 3D objects as a designer, in this case on a car that can be manipulated using your hands and feel vibrations on your fingers as response for an object appearing in front of your lenses in physical space.

We enjoyed working on every aspect of this project. Special thanks to the ATLAS Community at CU Boulder and professor Daniel Leithinger for his guidance and advice.

Thank you.
