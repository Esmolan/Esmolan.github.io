## Project Description:

Ho'ohui is an augmented reality experiment done for a Haptic Interface class at CU Boulder. 

Our intention was to think about how augmented reality be applied in some use case and implement haptics. Today, mixed reality is an emerging technology and is expected to have high demands in various applications. Therefore, we wanted to give the example on how others can experiment with this technology, in our case with augmented reality to build this open sourced project. Augmented reality tehcnologies right now are expensive and with this type of project it can become more accessible to anyone. 

Moreover, most applications in augmented reality do not offer enough kinesthetic communication or the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. Therefore, our use case scenario was to use augmented reality to visualize 3D objects as a designer, in this case for a car and be able to manipulate the object with your hands and feel vibrations in your finger.

We enjoyed working on every aspect of this project. Special thanks to the ATLAS Community at CU Boulder and professor Daniel Leithinger for his guidance and advice.

Thank you.
